# Soumallo Deb — Developer Portfolio

A responsive, dark glassmorphic portfolio site built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. Surreal 3D hero forms, spring-driven pointer tilt, continuous transforms, a moving capabilities band, and scroll-linked section motion give the experience depth; reduced-motion preferences are respected. It is a fully static single-page site: there are no server-side routes, backend API routes, or database. The contact form submits from the browser to Formspree.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 22 or later and npm.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite prints the local preview URL (normally `http://localhost:5173`). To check a production build locally:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The deployable static files are written to `dist/`.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

This repository is named `kadevoss.github.io`, so it is configured as a GitHub Pages user site served from the domain root. `vite.config.js` sets `base: '/'`, which is the correct asset path for this repository.

A GitHub Actions workflow is included at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. To deploy:

1. Push or merge the site to the repository's `main` branch.
2. In GitHub, open **Settings → Pages** and set the build/deployment source to **GitHub Actions**.
3. The workflow installs dependencies, builds the static site, and publishes `dist/` to Pages. You can also run it with **Actions → Deploy to GitHub Pages → Run workflow**.

If you later deploy this as a project site under `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`, change the Vite `base` value to `'/<repository>/'` before building. Keep `'/'` for the current `kadevoss.github.io` user-site repository.

## Before launch

### Connect the contact form

1. Create a form at [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) and copy its form ID.
2. In `src/components/Contact.jsx`, replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` in `FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT` with that ID, keeping the `https://formspree.io/f/` prefix.
3. Submit a test message from the deployed page and confirm it arrives in the inbox configured in Formspree.

The current endpoint is intentionally a placeholder. Until it is replaced, submitting the form displays a setup message and does not send data anywhere.

### Replace portfolio placeholders

- Replace the three clearly labeled speculative project concepts in `src/components/Work.jsx` with real work when ready. The project rail supports smooth vertical mouse-wheel-to-horizontal scrolling, native touch/trackpad scrolling, arrow controls, and a smooth handoff back to page scrolling at either edge; its project CTA currently points to Contact.
- The services rail in `src/components/Services.jsx` contains seven editable concept offerings, including business websites, full-stack web apps, AI-powered features, commerce, product design, automation, and performance/SEO. It uses the same smooth horizontal scrolling and edge handoff pattern and can be edited as the offering evolves.
- Update the clearly marked `YOUR_*` social link placeholders in `src/components/SocialLinks.jsx`.
- Review the canonical and Open Graph URLs in `index.html` if the deployed domain changes. The social share card is `public/og-card.png` (with an editable SVG source alongside it).

No real email address, phone number, or social profile is included in the starter content.
